          Warm Welcome to Our New Students and Families! <br />
          Dear Students and Parents,
          <br />
          <br />
          Welcome to our school family! It is with heartfelt joy that I extend
          this greeting to each of you as you join our vibrant community. I am
          Architect Nkemakonam Mabel Ubor, the Director here at New Gabselina
          Schools, and I am genuinely excited to get to know each one of you.
          Starting at a new school is an exciting adventure, full of new
          experiences and opportunities. Our school is more than just a place
          for learning; it is a place where we grow together, both in knowledge
          and character. We are deeply committed to helping your child not only
          excel academically but also develop into a person of strong moral
          character. Our vision is simple yet profound: to nurture young minds
          and hearts, guiding them to become compassionate, respectful, and
          thoughtful individuals. We believe that the true measure of success
          lies not just in grades, but in the kindness, integrity, and
          resilience our students show in their daily lives. You will find that
          our teachers and staff are dedicated to creating a warm and supportive
          environment where every student feels valued and inspired. We are here
          to encourage curiosity, celebrate achievements, and help your child
          navigate challenges with confidence. We also recognize the importance
          of partnership with parents. Your involvement and insights are
          invaluable, and we are eager to work together to ensure that your
          childs experience at New Gabselina Schools is both enriching and
          fulfilling. Please know that my door is always open for conversations,
          questions, or simply to share a moment of joy about your childs
          progress. Thank you for choosing to be part of our community. We are
          looking forward to an amazing year ahead, filled with growth,
          learning, and unforgettable memories.
          <br />
          <br />
          With warmest regards,
          <br />
